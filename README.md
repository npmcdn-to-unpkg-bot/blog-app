# Blog-app
## A simple blog app using React + Redux
### Published [here](http://cs52-eoberstein-auth-blogapp.surge.sh)

This was my first app using the Redux framework. I used a preexisting API to create, fetch, update and delete blog posts. User sign-in requires users to be authenticated to create, update and delete posts. Anyone can see the posts without authentication. All my actions were organized into an action.index.js file and a reducer updated state after fecthing multiple or just one post.

At first, figuring out where the piecese of everything went with Redux was challenging. Once I got the hang of actions and reducers, everything fit together nicely.

### Extra features
* Stylized index and new post page
